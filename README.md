# React Native Counter App

A basic React Native counter app that allows you to increment a counter value by tapping a button, created to understand the fundamentals of React Native.

## Installation

To run the React Native counter app, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the project source code.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the React Native counter app using the following steps:

1. Ensure you have an Android or iOS emulator running, or connect a physical device for testing.
2. In the terminal, run the following command to start the development server:

   ```
   npx react-native start
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, run the following command to launch the app on your emulator or device:

   - For Android:

     ```
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

   - For iOS:

     ```
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

4. The app should open on your emulator or device, displaying a logo, title, subtitle, and a button with a counter value.
5. Tap the button to increment the counter and observe the updated value.

## Customization

You can customize the app by modifying the styles in the `styles` object defined in the `App.js` file. Feel free to experiment with different colors, font sizes, and other style properties to personalize the app according to your preferences.
